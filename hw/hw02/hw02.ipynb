    "In the book [MoneyBall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball), Michael Lewis documented the introduction of statistics and data science in selecting players for the Oakland A's. \n",

    "The central premise of Moneyball is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the front office) over the past century is outdated, subjective, and often flawed. That the statistics traditionally used to gauge players, such as stolen bases, runs batted in, and batting average, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game.  Sabermetrics and statistical analysis had demonstrated, for example, that on-base percentage and slugging percentage are better measures of batting. The Oakland A's began seeking players who were \"undervalued in the market\"—that is, who were receiving lower salaries relative to their ability to contribute to winning, as measured by these advanced statistics.\n",
